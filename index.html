            <p>The Sopranos is a show about organized crime portraying mostly Italian Americans. Only 26% of the characters are female and most of them are connected to the males in a marital or romantic relationship. There are only few female characters who have an important role in the plot that is not through their relationship to their male partner. Females on average have lower importance in the network of characters (as measured by their eigenvector centrality). The wives or fianc√©s have higher importance than the average female and even than the average male (thanks to right-skewed distribution of eigenvector centrality for the males). Mistresses have lower importance than the average female (since the relationship has to be kept secret). Females in other categories have the lowest importance.</p>
