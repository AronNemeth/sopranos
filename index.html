            <p>The Sopranos is a show about organized crime portraying mostly Italian Americans. The story is male dominated and most female characters are connected to the males in a marital or romantic relationship. The figure investigates the importance of different groups of female characters (measured by eigenvector centrality) compared to the average female character. The wives and fianc√©s have the highest influence, since they are official members of their families. So they can form connections in the male dominated world of the show. As it can be expected mistresses have lower importance than the average female because the relationship has to be a secret. Those who have no marital or romantic relationship with a male are not important in the plot.</p>
